# Goal 1 Provider Plan

Goal 1 is module-based WebRacket programs in the browser, without relying on
`eval` and without the old textual stdlib path. The provider strategy is
curated: use installed Racket providers when they compose cleanly, and use
WebRacket-owned staged providers when installed providers drag in contracts,
chaperones, expander internals, unsupported keyword metadata, or browser-hostile
runtime services.

## Provider Classes

- `installed-provider-graph`: an installed Racket library is extracted and
  composed through the module bridge. These rows need more than a one-function
  smoke before we trust them as broadly supported.
- `installed-provider-coverage`: a broader dashboard row for an installed
  provider that exercises several common APIs. These rows are intentionally
  separate from the basic smoke rows so failures can be classified without
  hiding the small signal.
- `language-staged-provider`: a WebRacket-owned provider substitutes for a
  Racket library or a library-like surface. These providers are browser-first
  and deliberately avoid postponed features such as contracts, generic
  interfaces, chaperones, and impersonators unless explicitly documented.
- `staged-provider-slice`: staged original Racket code that is extracted or
  demodularized as a reusable provider, such as `io/format` and `regexp`.
- `ffi-module`: a module whose require implies an unsafe FFI bundle, such as
  `js/math` or `js/console`.

## Current Staged Providers

- `webracket/function`: contract-free positional combinators. It intentionally
  does not yet preserve the full keyword arity metadata of installed
  `racket/function`.
- `webracket/set`: hash-backed set operations. Contracts, generics,
  chaperones, and impersonators are postponed.
- `webracket/promise`: ordinary promise caching for browser programs. Advanced
  synchronization-oriented promise variants are postponed.
- `webracket/stream`: finite stream constructors and selectors for common
  module programs. It avoids importing the full `racket/stream` implementation.
- `webracket/contract`: erased contracts. It preserves provider shape and common
  forms, but it does not enforce contracts.
- `webracket/file`: a small VFS-oriented file provider. This is useful for
  browser tests and examples, but it is not a complete host filesystem story.
- `webracket/format`: compact formatting surface while the staged `io/format`
  provider continues to grow.

## Routing Rule

If `webracket/full` exposes a name that has a staged WebRacket provider, prefer
the staged provider over the installed provider. This keeps `webracket/full`
from accidentally becoming a tunnel into arbitrary installed Racket internals.

The concrete regression to guard is `compose` and `compose1`: `racket/base`
exports them, and installed `racket/function` / `racket/private/list` can pull
in keyword-preserving wrappers that WebRacket does not need for ordinary
positional module programs. `webracket/full` therefore exports the staged
`webracket/function` versions for those names.

## Compatibility Policy

- Passing a basic dashboard row means the provider composes and one common use
  works.
- Passing a coverage row means a small representative API cluster works.
- Neither is a claim of full Racket compatibility.
- When a coverage row fails, decide whether to improve WebRacket primitives,
  improve a staged provider, or explicitly postpone that part of the API.
